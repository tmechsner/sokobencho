# Sokobencho
Small Sokoban clone with some extras I wrote some years ago.
Doesn't include tests as I was not into testing back then..

Place all boxes on a target to get to the next level.
There are some special tiles like cracked floor, moveable rocks and teleporters for player / objects, doors and so on.

Controls:
Arrow keys / W, A, S, D - Move <br />
R - Reset the level <br />
Q - Quit <br />

Have fun!
